# Neta Packaging Platform

This project—**Neta Packaging Platform**—was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It’s designed as an MVP for collecting, validating, and analyzing vendor packaging submissions in support of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) compliance.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode with hot reloading.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production into the `build` folder—it’s optimized, minified, and ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`
**Warning: This is a one-way operation!**  
Ejecting copies all configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you can customize them directly. Use this only if the default setup doesn’t meet your needs.
